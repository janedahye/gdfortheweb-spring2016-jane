			<h3>Hannah Bae</h3>
			<p>When you hear about an ice cream flavor that’s named "Sweet as Bae,” you might think that Hannah Bae, the ice cream maker and founder of Noona's Ice Cream, is just as whimsical and fluffy. But this ice cream master is calm, grounded, and motivated by a deep sense of love and family.
