			<h3>Do Ho Suh</h3>
			<p>Born in 1962 in Seoul, South Korea, Do Ho Suh’s art is very much rooted by his own history of migration, having moved to the United States in his late twenties. From his sculptures, installations and drawings, his works explore the notion of personal space, the boundaries of identity, and the relationship between the individual and the collective body. He is best-known for his extraordinary fabric sculptures – carefully rendered full-scale replicas of personal spaces of the artist, from his childhood home in Seoul, to his New York apartment and studio.
